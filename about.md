Hi, I'm Gavin. Thanks for visiting my personal website. I'm really interested in game development, computer graphics and computer programming in general, so this is where I share a lot of what I've worked on and am working on right now. If you are interested in game development as well then good for you! You've come to the right place! 

I got my Bachelor of Computer Science from University of Waterloo back in 2015 and since than I've been working as a software developer as my full-time job. But I have been making some games and small projects using Unity on the side. 

If you would love to connect with me to talk about game development and stuff I would be happy to! Just connect me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiangyugavinluo/) or send me an email at [luoxiangyu528@gmail.com](mailto:luoxiangyu528@gmail.com). Cheers and happy hacking!
