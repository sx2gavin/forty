Hi, I'm Gavin. Thanks for visiting my game development portfolio website. I'm really interested in game development, computer graphics and computer programming in general, so this is where I share a lot of what I've worked on and am working on right now.

I got my Bachelor of Computer Science Degree from University of Waterloo back in 2015 and since then I worked as a software developer for four years, before making the transition to game development industry. I learnt both Unity3D game engine and Unreal Engine 4 in my spare time and now I am working full-time as a Unity Developer. I am still learning new things and building my own prototypes in my spare time and I will be sharing my work in this portfolio.

Feel free to connect me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiangyugavinluo/). Thanks again for visiting my website and have a great day!
