I saw a video on YouTube by [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) called [Coding Adventure: Portals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWpFZbjtSQg), I thought the topic was really interesting so I've decided to follow along and try to implement my own version of the portals. Computer Graphics and rendering are always a big interests of mine so I wanted to use this opportunity to learn about rendering in general, as well as some Shader coding in Unity. In this article I've documented all the steps I did in order to achieve the same portal effects in the video. I will also have a link to my Github repo in case anybody wants to check it out.
