Paragon Shooter is a 3rd person shooter game demo I made in Unreal Engine 4. I implemented the gameplay aspects of this demo that includes the character movement, gun play, ammo management, character health, enemy AI, HUD and UMG, weapon switching system and pick up system. The level environment and character models that I used are assets from Epic store.

Assets that I used from Epic store:
- Character Model - [Paragon: Wraith](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/paragon-wraith)
- Level Design - [Modular SciFi](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/modular-scifi-season-1-starter-bundle)
